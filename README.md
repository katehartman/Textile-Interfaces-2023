## Course Details

### Description
Want to make an interface that can be squished, stretched, stroked, or smooshed? This course will introduce the use of electronic textiles as sensors. Focus will be placed on physical interaction design – working with the affordances of these materials to create interfaces designed to invite or demand diverse types of physical interaction. This course does not require knowledge or love of sewing – a variety of construction methods will be introduced. It will rely on a physical computing approach, with Arduino being used to read sensor values. Working with a breadth of conductive and resistive materials, students will learn to design and create bespoke alternative interfaces that can live in our clothing, furniture, and built environments.


### Additional Notes
For two days we are going to function as the pop up research lab. Our area of exploration is materials and techniques that can be used to create textile interfaces for interactive systems. We will use conductive and resistive fabrics and threads as well as both soft and hard prototyping techniques. Our approach is learning through making and testing. When considering the possibilities, we don’t just read about it. We try it, determine what works, what doesn’t, and get inspired by the possibilities and constraints.

### Costs
There are many great tools and materials available for prototyping custom sensors but because this is a very short course I will mostly encourage you to work off of your existing physical computing parts and only acquire more based on your research interests and project ideas.

### Documentation
This course is focused on quick rounds of learning, making, and testing. It is essential to document your work as you go. Make an effort to produce clean and clear materials – well-lit and well-composed images and thoughtful and well-edited writing, data collection, and notes. Use documentation for an opportunity for synthesis and reflection. This will help to inform future projects.

### Deliverables

* **Deadline:** Monday, November 20, 2023, end-of-day, AOE
* **Submission Link:** https://forms.gle/VNUWnBYibhczdS6e9

Documentation of all works created for this course are submitted as a single blog post. This includes:
* E-Textile Tester
* High-Five Gloves
* Digital Textile Switches
	* A push button
	* More than one digital switch with a shared ground
* Analog Textile Sensor 
* Textile Game Controller

As the final project for the course, the Textile Game Controller should be covered in more detail. Include the following:
* project title
* project description, including
	* general concept - is it a wearable? A handheld? Part of the furniture? Mounted on the floor or wall?
* how the game controller works 
	* digital switches? 
	* analog sensors?
	* both?
* photos of the controller (pay attention to focus, composition, background, and context)
* a video (60 seconds max) of the game controller in use with the Pong game
* materials list - be specific
* circuit diagram, only if different from the example
* code, only if different from the example
* any additional items
	* process photos and/or notes
	* explanation of design choices
	* any supporting illustrations or diagrams
	* lessons learned / next steps

### Statement of Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### Statement of Principle
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online: \

Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### Statement on Use of Electronic Devices
Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lectures. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.  Phone use in class is strictly prohibited unless directly related to a presentation of your own work or if you are asked to do so as part of the curriculum.

### Statement on Title IX
